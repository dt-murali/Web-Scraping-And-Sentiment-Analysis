# Web-Scraping-And-Sentiment-Analysis

## Problem overview
The "ScrapeSense" project automates the extraction and sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews. Using Flask for the interface and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, the app collects reviews from a product page and analyzes them with NLTK's VADER sentiment tool. It then displays the results in both a table format, showing individual review ratings and sentiments, and a plot of overall sentiment distribution. The goal is to simplify the process of understanding customer feedback through automated scraping and analysis.

## Workflow
1. **User Input:** The user enters an Amazon product URL in the web interface and clicks submit.
2. **Web Scraping:** The Flask backend takes the URL, fetches the product's reviews from Amazon using BeautifulSoup, and processes the review data (ratings and text).
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Each review is analyzed using the NLTK VADER tool to determine if itâ€™s positive, negative, or neutral.
4. **Visualization:** The results are displayed on the webpage, either as a table with individual review sentiments or as a plot showing the overall sentiment distribution.
5. **Results Display:** The user can switch between the table and plot views to understand the reviews' sentiments for the product.

This process helps the user quickly analyze and visualize sentiments from Amazon product reviews.
